  ## Description
  Given a webpage on SEO with an incomplete and repetitive CSS file, I cleaned up the css file to cut down on redundant code as well as adjusted the class attributes     in the html file to call from the appropriate parts of the css file. I also renamed the "div" tags in order to increase readability.
